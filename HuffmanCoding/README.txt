Our compression took relatively longer than Mike's for the entire folder.
On files like through the looking glass, syllabus, recursion, we had similar compression times.
However the CIA factbook took us much longer to compress than Mike. I conclude that ours was slower
due to something other than simply the Big O. The CIA factbook has alot of repeated letters of the full range
including special characters. This would make the P Queue very long and the creation of the HUffman tree take long.

Calgary
The Calgary comparisons db has several other compression programs to compare to. It looks like
our huffman compression is much faster than the others on all aspects.

Waterloo

Waterloo contains several bitmaps. The huffman compressed the images fairly small,
but not close to PNG, BCIF, PCIF. The closest compressed size was JPEG. But HUffman is a lossless
compression which isnt always the best for images. JPEG, a lossy compression make the size
much smaller, but loses image quality. In any case, huffman did its job.


In general
small files will remain small if we use a tree format compression header, because we dont have to write out
the frequencies of unused characters. Also frequently and isolated values will make for
a small compression, such a black and white image. Text files had lost of compression while images had
little compression effect.
